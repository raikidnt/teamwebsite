                    <p>I am a freshman in computer science and I just started to get to know computer last year 2022. I hadn’t access to computer much because I didn’t have my own computer. I just bought my computer to study about IT profession and searching for more knowledge about IT. I took a 1 year gap to find my true potential, capability and passion. I ended up taking the computer science course here at RMIT and I believe that I have finally settle and follow my true passion. I really love computer science, I find interested in learning to understand this complicated system which helps humans a lot. Since the computer has assist us so much, I want to understand,develop it so it will get better and become more useful for human. I am also looking forward to make more friends and enjoying the university life. </p>

                    <h2>Minsung Kim</h2>
                    <p>I am a rmit student in the Bachelor of IT. The IT job I want to do in the future is to develop applications and the web to create useful technologies for people. So far, I have learned Python and SQL, and now I am learning Java and HTML. After coming to Vietnam, I visited the store in person and purchased any items that I needed due to language or culture barriers. However, as a consumer who buys a variety of items, it was very troublesome to go outside frequently and I found sites like shoppe and Lazada myself. So I wanted to make websites and applications related to shopping so that everyone could use and access them. Because of this, I chose this topic because I wanted to develop a shopping website with my team members in a more convenient and functional way.

                    <p>I like to try new things and discover new things. For example, learn new coding skills or try foods that I haven't tried before. Since I was young, it has been my happiness to try and play various video games. Therefore, I became interested in the profession of programmers who make games, and I decided to learn about IT in the university. I will successfully finish this group project with the advantage of discovering something new. Furthermore, I have experienced various shopping websites to buy various games. I have often experienced some inconveniences when I buy games on the Internet. Based on that experience, I want to create a </p>

                    <h2>Do Nhat Thanh</h2>
                    <p>I am a first year student in the Bachelor of IT. I've been fascinated by computers and softwares since I was a child. So I decided to go the route of becoming a programmer by learning from the seniors and peers. Because of that, I am interested in this team project work and dedicate myself to learn more from the project. Though my experience and knowledge are minor, I am always eager to research and do my best for the project. I’ve been buying things online and also know a little about how e-commerce works. For that reason, I feel that I can propose some great ideas to the team projects

                        <p>In this day and age, online shopping has risen to become one of the most favourite types of goods consumed in our daily life. 
                            Online shopping applications exist all over the Internet and are superbly attractive, convenient and easy to use. 
                            They have taken part in the enormous increase of new customers on this platform. 
                            We as newbie developers will introduce a promising project which will definitely attract potential customers to visit and enjoy their time here. 
                            Our project is a shopping website which specialises in providing technology goods. 
                            Although there are giant, popular websites such as Amazon, eBay, Etsy which are already dominating the market, we strongly believe our platform will make its way to the public due to its convenient and easy-to-use features.
