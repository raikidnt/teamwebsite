                        <h2>Our Idea behind</h2>
                        <p>In this day and age, online shopping has risen to become one of the most favourite types of goods consumed in our daily life. 
                            Online shopping applications exist all over the Internet and are superbly attractive, convenient and easy to use. 
                            They have taken part in the enormous increase of new customers on this platform. 
                            We as newbie developers will introduce a promising project which will definitely attract potential customers to visit and enjoy their time here. 
                            Our project is a shopping website which specialises in providing technology goods. 
                            Although there are giant, popular websites such as Amazon, eBay, Etsy which are already dominating the market, we strongly believe our platform will make its way to the public due to its convenient and easy-to-use features.
